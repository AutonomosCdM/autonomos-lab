# System Context: Autonomos_AiLab Architecture Overview

## Architecture Overview
A modular system of specialized agents with centralized communication

## Key Components

### Agent System
- Central orchestrator (based on LlamaIndex)
- Specialized agents (using Langchain tools)
- Shared memory system (for context between agents)
- Query router (to direct tasks to appropriate agent)

### Knowledge System
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for technical documentation
- GitHub/Hugging Face repository processor
- Previous solution indexer
- Technological trend analyzer

### Communication System
- Slack API integration (individual apps)
- Natural message generation system
- Agent profile manager
- Multi-channel conversation router

### Development System
- Code generator
- Automated testing system
- Solution documentor
- Deliverable packager

## Design Patterns
- Observer pattern for notifications between agents
- Chain of Responsibility for message processing
- Factory Method for dynamic agent creation
- Adapter for external API integration
- Strategy for interchangeable processing algorithms
- Decorator for extending base agent capabilities

## Data Flow
1. User Input → Intention Analysis → Agent Routing → Processing → Response
2. External Knowledge Update: Source → Processor → Indexer → Knowledge Base
3. Solution Generation: Requirement → Planning → Code Generation → Testing → Deliverable

## Scalability Approach
- Microservices-based architecture for individual component scaling
- Caching of frequent queries to reduce API calls
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking tasks
- Task prioritization based on user value
