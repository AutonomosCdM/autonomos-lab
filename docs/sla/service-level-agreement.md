## Performance Guarantees

### System Performance Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99.95% monthly
- **Response Time**: 
  - Standard Queries: < 500ms
  - Complex AI Tasks: < 3 seconds
- **Scalability**: Dynamically handle up to 10,000 concurrent agent requests

### Performance Monitoring
```python
class SLAPerformanceMonitor:
    def validate_performance(self, metrics):
        """
        Validate system performance against SLA commitments
        """
        sla_checks = {
            'uptime': metrics['monthly_uptime'] >= 99.95,
            'standard_query_response': metrics['avg_standard_query_time'] < 500,
            'complex_query_response': metrics['avg_complex_query_time'] < 3000,
            'concurrent_request_capacity': metrics['max_concurrent_requests'] >= 10000
        }
        
        return all(sla_checks.values())
```

## Availability

### Availability Tiers
1. **Platinum Tier**: 99.99% Uptime
2. **Gold Tier**: 99.95% Uptime
3. **Silver Tier**: 99.90% Uptime

### Availability Calculation
- Monthly Availability = (Total Minutes - Downtime) / Total Minutes * 100%
- Planned maintenance excluded from downtime calculation

## Response Times

### Response Time Guarantees
- **Initial Response**: 
  - Critical Issues: < 15 minutes
  - High Priority: < 1 hour
  - Standard: < 4 hours
- **Resolution Time**:
  - Critical: < 4 hours

    [*] --> Reporting: Issue Reported
    Reporting --> Triage: Assess Severity
    Triage --> Escalation: Assign Priority
    Escalation --> Investigation: Analyze Issue
    Investigation --> Resolution: Implement Fix
    Resolution --> Verification: Validate Solution
    Verification --> [*]
```

## Support Levels

### Support Channels
- Email Support
- Slack Enterprise Channel
